# Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
# Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
# Explanation:
# rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
# rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
# rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
# Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
# Explanation:
# rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
# rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]

class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        n = len(nums)
        a = [0] * n
        for i in range(n):
            a[(i + k) % n] = nums[i]

        nums[:] = a

# Algorithm:
# We use an extra array in which we place every element of the array at its correct position
# i.e. the number at index i in the original array is placed at the index (i + k) % length of array.
# Then, we copy the new array to the original one.
